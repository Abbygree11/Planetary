# Planetary continuity

Repository: Abbygree11/Planetary
Branch: 2.0 only. Never write main.
Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.215, Java 21, Gradle 8.12.
User local check: git pull && .\test.ps1 && .\run-client.ps1
Never claim build/runtime success before user confirms it.

## Core architecture
Physical world is ordinary Minecraft XYZ / BlockPos.
Planet is one cube with odd diameter D=2R+1 and one core voxel.
Gravity is six infinite square-pyramid regions around the core.
Local frame is always X=EAST, Y=UP, Z=SOUTH; local DOWN points to core.
Entity deltaMovement is stored in LOCAL coordinates while in Planet gravity.
Entity.move converts local -> world for collision, then world -> local before vanilla collision/onGround/fall logic.
Face change preserves world momentum by old local -> world -> new local.
Camera rotation is smoothed; physics face switch is immediate.

## Worldgen architecture
Do NOT generate six faces independently.
PlanetGenerationSpace maps physical cube shells into one continuous generation space.
Terrain/caves/lakes/biome fields are WRAP.
Rigid structures are AVOID_EDGE.
Goal is normal BiomeSource/NeoForge biome pipeline compatibility, including TerraBlender/BOP where possible.

Dedicated world:
- selectable Planet preset works
- PlanetChunkGenerator registered
- initial test planet radius 48, core (0,128,0)
- one bedrock core, stone interior, grass shell
- fixed plains biome for now
- Planet gravity binds automatically

## Verified player behavior
Working on all faces:
- walking
- jumping
- gravity transitions
- camera
- first person overlay
- walking animation
- pose fit / false swimming fixed
- side push-out fixed

## Current bugs
1. Block rendering is still global-Y oriented.
   Grass top texture does not rotate to local UP.
2. Partial/directional blocks are global-Y.
   Torches are misplaced/oriented incorrectly.
   Pointed dripstone can only be placed along vanilla Y.
   Desired model: vanilla state directions are LOCAL semantics; placement/shape/render translate local<->world.
3. Fluids are global-Y.
   FlowingFluid hardcodes below/above, DOWN/UP, Plane.HORIZONTAL and Y-oriented fluid shapes.
4. Falling blocks:
   d165339 changed support/landing to local DOWN.
   Sand now physically falls in Planet gravity.
   Breaking/falling particles still accelerate toward world -Y.
5. Mob AI:
   before d165339 mobs repeatedly jumped on side faces.
   d165339 localized MoveControl target deltas.
   current report: mobs spin/rotate instead of walking.
   Root cause is GroundPathNavigation/WalkNodeEvaluator still assuming XZ horizontal and Y vertical.
   Next fix should be Planet-aware NodeEvaluator/navigation, not more random MoveControl patches.
6. Internal mining across gravity boundary is very disorienting.
   Physics is conceptually correct, but UX needs stronger hysteresis/camera/input transition assist.

## Relevant vanilla hardcodes found
Particle.tick: yd -= 0.04 * gravity.
Particle.move: onGround is blocked negative world-Y.
FallingBlock.tick: pos.below().
PointedDripstoneBlock TIP_DIRECTION only stores UP/DOWN and placement uses getNearestLookingVerticalDirection().
GroundPathNavigation/PathNavigation/WalkNodeEvaluator use below/above, Plane.HORIZONTAL, y+1 and world-Y floor logic.

## Preferred next architecture
Particles:
- gravity acceleration along frame.worldDown
- local-down collision/onGround classification

Blocks:
- treat vanilla blockstate directions as local values in Planet
- general shape/model transform by gravity frame
- placement/support logic translates local<->world
- avoid per-block hacks when a general boundary transform can solve the class

Mob navigation:
- PlanetWalkNodeEvaluator
- for every node select gravity frame at that physical position
- four neighbors are local N/S/E/W mapped to world directions
- support = candidate.relative(local DOWN)
- stepping uses local UP
- edge crossing naturally changes frame
- Path target anchor ~= cellCenter - localUp*0.5
- follow-path distance tests use local frame
